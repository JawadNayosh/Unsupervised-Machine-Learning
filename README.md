This repository contains my Unsupervised Machine Learning Homework for ANLY 6110 - Data Analytics II as part of my MBA in Business Analytics. This project demonstrates my ability to apply real-world data analysis techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and visualization, using Python. 

What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique used to uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled examples, unsupervised learning algorithms group similar data points or reduce data complexity without predefined categories. It is widely used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and feature extraction.

Key techniques used in this project include:
✅ Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) – Identifying natural groupings in data.
✅ Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) – Simplifying complex datasets while retaining critical information.
✅ Performance Evaluation Assessing the quality of the clustering process.

For details please see uploaded files of the project.
